let's take a ride to the bears and bees 
 i was a city boy 
 barely strong enough to stand 
 i pretend that i'm asleep 
 but show me 
 its so hard its so hard 
 where did she go? 
 i've been searchin' everywhere and now you know i'm down 
 this love 
 'cause your sex takes me to a place where i wanna go 
 you're just a stranger 
 a destiny fulfilled 
 just hold on to 
 no whoa whoa 
 if that'll make you mine 
 alright but don't change your mind 
 don't make it last 
 we find out what we're made of 
 when we were waitin' 
 started conversatin' 
 before we go 
 never had much faith in love or miracles 
 never been afraid to die young and live fast 
 and tell your little boyfriend 
 i still wish you the truth i can feel a change 
 cuz girl you're so far 
 can you hear me i can say is uhuuu 
 i promise it's a blessing 
 i should've known better 
 than the way it feels when we grind 
 then put your body rockin' side to side 
 to give me love give me love give me your word and i hope i can finally see
